# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. This is the place I will record whatever new things I did or I will do.
I will share my personal experiences with you and hope can help you a little bit someday.
My experiences and stories may look silly but bear with me, it is always a long way for a person, especially me hhhh, to grow up and become a master at something. 
But all I want now is trying to explore different things and hope I can eventually make something which may not be useful and even boring, but the process of learning new things and trial and errors are fun and exciting enough. (sounds like I am ready for failure lol)
And so, let's start. 

I'm Peiqi. Nice to see you here.
